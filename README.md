# Borwall example 1

The objective of this example was to reproduce the results presented in Borwall 2003. 

I modified the adjointShapeOptimization from alpha as the design variable to density as the design. However, neither the results presented in the paper were reproduced nor the gradiants seem to be going in any particular direction. 

## Conclusion:
I have serious doubts if Othmer's topology optimization work. 

## What next?
Lets try automatic differentiation.
